# TV-Series-AI-Analysis

This project demonstrates how to analyze your favorite TV series using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Natural Language Processing (NLP). It includes data scraping, theme extraction, character network creation, text classification, and chatbot development to simulate character conversations.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Data Scraping:**
   - Use Scrapy to gather data from websites. Customize the spider in the `scrapy_spider.py` file.

2. **Theme Extraction:**
   - Use Hugging Face and Transformers to implement zero-shot classification for identifying the main themes.

3. **Character Network:**
   - Build and visualize a character network with NER models using Spacy, NetworkX, and Pyviz.

4. **Text Classification:**
   - Train a custom text classifier on a dataset of your choice using Hugging Face and Transformers.

5. **Character Chatbot:**
   - Build a chatbot to simulate conversations with your favorite TV series characters.
